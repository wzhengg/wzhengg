### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m William Zheng
I'm an aspiring software engineer with an interest in the practical application of theory to technical challenges such as software scalability, architecture, and design. I love learning new programming languages and tech stacks, so I have a hard time sticking to any specific field, but for now, I'm trying my best to get good at full-stack web development.
